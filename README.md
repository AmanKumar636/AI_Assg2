# AI Assignment 2: Search and Optimization

This project implements and evaluates search and optimization algorithms on two distinct environments:

- **Search Algorithms (on Frozen Lake Environment)**
  - **Branch and Bound (BnB)**
  - **Iterative Deepening A\*** (IDA*)

- **Optimization Algorithms (for the Travelling Salesman Problem, TSP)**
  - **Hill Climbing (HC)**
  - **Simulated Annealing (SA)**

The goal is to compare their performance in terms of reward/cost, time, and convergence characteristics.

## Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.x along with the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Running the Experiments
To execute the experiments and generate the results:

python src/utils.py

This script will:

Run the search algorithms (BnB and IDA*) on the Frozen Lake environment.
Run the optimization algorithms (Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing) on a TSP instance.
Print out metrics (cost, iterations, runtime) for each run (5 trials per algorithm).
Save the results to data/results.csv.
Display a bar chart comparing the average execution times.
